{"name":"Mongoose-softdelete","tagline":"Soft delete MongoDB documents","body":"Mongoose Soft Delete Plugin\r\n============================\r\n\r\nMongoose plugin that enables soft deletion of Models/Documents.  \r\n\r\nThis plugin is based on the work of [Yi](https://github.com/yi).  \r\n\r\n## What's Different  \r\nIn the original plugin, models were deleted with a date reference only. This version takes that and adds user handling. Now, whoever deleted the data will be recorded in the DB. Additionally, it removes a lot of overhead from the original code and simplifies it and doesn't use Coffeescript for the original code. Also included is an example express app to see if the plugin works.  \r\n\r\n## License  \r\nThis plugin is licensed under the MIT license and can ve viewed in the LICENSE file.  \r\n\r\n## Installation  \r\nInstall using [npm](https://npmjs.org)  \r\n```\r\nnpm install mongoose-softdelete\r\n```  \r\n\r\nTo use the example app  \r\n```\r\ngrunt\r\n```  \r\n\r\nThis will start an express server on port 3000 after successful linting. You can view the example at localhost:3000 in your browser. The console will show a message if the operation is successful and the app will exit.\r\n\r\nTo start example without linting\r\n```\r\ngrunt express:dev:start\r\n```  \r\n\r\nTo lint only\r\n```\r\ngrunt jshint\r\n```  \r\n\r\n## Usage \r\n```\r\nvar mongoose = require('mongoose'),\r\n    Schema = mongoose.Schema,\r\n    soft_delete = require('mongoose-softdelete');\r\n\r\nvar Test = new Schema({\r\n  somefield: { type: String, default: 'Hello World!'}\r\n});\r\n\r\nTest.plugin(soft_delete);\r\n\r\ninstance = new Test();\r\n\r\nvar user = {};\r\nuser._id = '23213d123dw12fsfsf';\r\n\r\ninstance.bin(user, function(err, done) {\r\n  console.log(done.deleted_at);\r\n});\r\n```  \r\n\r\n## Copyright  \r\nCopyright 2014 [Riyadh Al Nur](https://github.com/riyadhalnur) and [AFM Sayem](https://github.com/afm-sayem).  \r\nBuilt with love at @NewsCred, Dhaka, Bangladesh.\r\n","google":"UA-49473294-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
