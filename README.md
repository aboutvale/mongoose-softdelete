Mongoose Soft Delete Plugin
============================

Mongoose plugin that enables soft deletion of Models/Documents.  

This plugin is based on the work of [Yi](https://github.com/yi).  

## What's Different  
In the original plugin, models were deleted with a date reference only. This version takes that and adds user handling. Now, whoever deleted the data will be recorded in the DB. Additionally, it removes a lot of overhead from the original code and simplifies it. Also included is an example express app to see if the plugin works.
